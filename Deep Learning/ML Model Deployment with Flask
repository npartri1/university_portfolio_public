ML Model Deployment with Flask

In this assignment, I deployed a Flask web app with a model based on data from the Titanic incident. This project used a pickled model, an accompanying Python app script, and HTML format sheets to deploy this functioning app that allows users to input values for a variety of features and use these values in the model to predict Titanic survival outcomes.
