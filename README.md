This repository is a curated portfolio showcasing my data science projects from my Master of Science in Data Science program at Eastern University.

The full project code and datasets are stored in a private repository to protect the academic integrity of the Eastern University DTSC program, but I am happy to grant access to potential employers interested in the scope of my abilities.

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or collaborator and would like access to the full repository,  
please feel free to **[request access](mailto:nathanrobertpartridge@gmail.com)** (email: nathanrobertpartridge@gmail.com) or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanpartridge/).
