Hidden Markov Model Viterbi NLP

In this assignment, I apply a Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithm to the Brown Corpus for the purpose of probabilistic sequence tagging. I experiment with different Lidstone probability distribution gamma levels across a series of HMMs to determine the best amount of smoothing for my model.
