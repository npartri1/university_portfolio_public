Final Project

In the final project for my Statistical Modeling in R class, I completed a structured part 1 and more independent part 2. Both parts dealt with the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, which is available online, though was too large for this GitHub repository. Part 1 consisted of using the Tidyverse to clean, manipulate and explore this large dataset. This included not only simple data cleaning and manipulation tasks, but also more exploratory mutations. Finally, I created different linear and logistic regression models to evaluate the relationships between several selected features and the outcome variable. Part 2 displays similar skills, but with the added inclusion of self-guided data exploration, visualization with ggplot, and project development, organization, and communication skills more broadly.
